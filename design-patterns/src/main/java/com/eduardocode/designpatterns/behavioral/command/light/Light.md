This example demonstrates the Command pattern by using a RemoteControl class that can execute different commands (turn on or turn off a light) depending on the current command it's been set to. The Light class represents the Receiver, the LightOnCommand and LightOffCommand are the ConcreteCommands and the RemoteControl is the Invoker. This way the RemoteControl is decoupled from the Light class and can be used to control other objects as well.
