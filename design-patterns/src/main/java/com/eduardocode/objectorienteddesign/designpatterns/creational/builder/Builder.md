# Builder Design Pattern
There are several ways to create a builder design pattern class in Java, some of the most common ones are:

Nested static class: This is the most common way to create a builder class. A nested static class is defined within the class that it builds and it has access to the private fields and constructors of the outer class. This approach provides a clear separation of concerns and encapsulation.

Separate class: Instead of using a nested class, you can create a separate class that acts as a builder. This class usually has a constructor that takes an instance of the class it builds as a parameter and it provides methods to set its fields. This approach is useful when you want to reuse the builder class with other classes or when the class being built is not under your control.

Fluent interface: This approach uses method chaining to set the fields of the class being built. Each method of the builder returns an instance of the builder, allowing the caller to chain method calls. This makes the code more readable, but it can be harder to read if the number of fields is large.

JavaBean pattern: This approach uses setter methods to set the fields of the class being built. The build method returns an instance of the class with the fields set. This approach is similar to the fluent interface, but it follows the JavaBean pattern that is more commonly used in Java.

The choice of which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you have a simple class with a few fields, the nested static class approach may be sufficient. If you need to reuse the builder class with other classes, the separate class approach may be more appropriate. If you want to make the code more readable and you don't have many fields, the fluent interface or JavaBean pattern may be useful.
