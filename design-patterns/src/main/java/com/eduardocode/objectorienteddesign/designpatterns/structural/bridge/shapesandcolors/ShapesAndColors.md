This program uses the bridge design pattern, where the Color interface and its implementations (RedColor and GreenColor) are separated from the Shape abstract class and its implementations (Triangle and Circle), allowing for changes in the color to be made independently of changes to the shape. The Shape class holds a reference to the Color interface and when the drawShape method is called, it uses the color to apply the color to the shape. This way the color is decoupled from the shape and it can be changed independently.
